The code in this repo is our (Ashwin Rastogi, Galen Kimball, Satiya Kem) solution to the
CS 170 Spring 2020 Project. The problem is essentially equivalent to the Minimum Connected
Dominating Set problem. Our final solution is that of a greedy algorithm. Unfortunately, we
were unable to complete the implementation of the ILP approach which was promising and could've
resulted with closer to optimal results (we faced many bugs having to do with the connectivity of
the solution).

Instructions for use:

To run the algorithm, execute 'python3 solver.py filepath' in terminal with the correct filepath.
Alternatively, call the solve() method in the solver.py file.
